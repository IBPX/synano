For a user specific install, it's generally placed in `~/.nanorc`.

### Include method

Get the file you want and place it somewhere publicly accessable. Then edit
your nanorc to include this line:

     include /wherever/you/put/the/file/you/chose.nanorc

### Copy-paste method

Alternatively, you can copy the contents of the file you chose and append it to
your nanorc.
